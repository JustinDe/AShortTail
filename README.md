My first "game" writen in C#. Written using Visual Studio. This game was my very first entry into Global Game Jam 2012 as well as my first time meeting the Cleveland Game Developers. All code reamins untouched since January 2012. Art by Heather Huotari Music by Ian Faleer Programming by Justin Demetroff
